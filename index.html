                                The theory of Forms or theory of Ideas is a philosophical theory, concept, or
                                world-view, attributed to Plato, that the physical world is not as real or true as
                                timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas.[4] According to this theory, ideas in this
                                sense, often capitalized and translated as "Ideas" or "Forms", are the non-physical
                                essences of all things, of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely
                                imitations. Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily
                                Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggests that these Forms are the only objects
                                of study that can provide knowledge. The theory itself is contested from within Plato's
                                dialogues, and it is a general point of controversy in philosophy. Nonetheless, the
                                theory is considered to be a classical solution to the problem of universals.
                                The early Greek concept of form precedes attested philosophical usage and is represented
                                by a number of words mainly having to do with vision, sight, and appearance. Plato uses
                                these aspects of sight and appearance from the early Greek concept of the form in his
                                dialogues to explain the Forms and the Good.

                                The Apollonian and Dionysian is a two-fold philosophical concept, based on features of
                                ancient Greek mythology: Apollo and Dionysus. This relationship takes the form of a
                                dialectic. Even though the concept is famously related to The Birth of Tragedy, the poet
                                Hölderlin had already spoken of it, and Winckelmann had talked of Bacchus.
                                Nietzsche found in classical Athenian tragedy an art form that transcended the pessimism
                                found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the
                                abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously
                                affirmed life, finding it worth living. The main theme in The Birth of Tragedy is that
                                the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttriebe ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic
                                arts or tragedies. He argued that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient
                                Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity, logic and the principle
                                of individuation, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion, ecstasy
                                and unity (hence the omission of the principle of individuation). Nietzsche used these
                                two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and
                                chaos on the other, formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the
                                Apollonian a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian a state of intoxication,
                                representing the liberations of instinct and dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, a
                                man appears as the satyr. He is the horror of the annihilation of the principle of
                                individuality and at the same time someone who delights in its destruction. Both of
                                these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the
                                power of nature in man.
                                Apollonian and Dionysian juxtapositions appear in the interplay of tragedy: the tragic
                                hero of the drama, the main protagonist, struggles to make (Apollonian) order of his
                                unjust and chaotic (Dionysian) fate, though he dies unfulfilled. Elaborating on the
                                conception of Hamlet as an intellectual who cannot make up his mind, and is a living
                                antithesis to the man of action, Nietzsche argues that a Dionysian figure possesses the
                                knowledge that his actions cannot change the eternal balance of things, and it disgusts
                                him enough not to act at all. Hamlet falls under this category—he glimpsed the
                                supernatural reality through the Ghost, he has gained true knowledge and knows that no
                                action of his has the power to change this. For the audience of such drama, this tragedy
                                allows them to sense what Nietzsche called the Primordial Unity, which revives Dionysian
                                nature. He describes primordial unity as the increase of strength, the experience of
                                fullness and plenitude bestowed by frenzy. Frenzy acts as intoxication and is crucial
                                for the physiological condition that enables the creation of any art.
